ðŸ“š Library Management System â€“ Python

This is a simple **Library Management System (LMS)** built using **Python** as part of my internship at **Tridot Tech**.  
It is a command-line interface (CLI) based application that allows users to manage library operations like issuing and returning books, adding members, and calculating fines.

âœ… Key Features

- ðŸ“˜ Add and view books and members  
- ðŸ”„ Issue and return books  
- ðŸ’° Calculate late return fines  
- ðŸ’¾ Persistent data storage using text files  
- ðŸ“‚ Organized using Python functions and modular structure

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **Python** (Core Concepts)
- File Handling
- Functions and Modules
- CLI-based Interaction (no GUI)

ðŸ§  Learning Outcomes

This project helped me:

- Practice real-world Python use cases  
- Improve logical and structured thinking  
- Understand how to build scalable CLI tools  
- Gain hands-on experience in applying core concepts


Grateful to **Tridot Tech** for the internship opportunity and support in building this project.
